# Airbnb: TacoKeeper Walking Tour

## English

### About you

I was born in Mexico City and have lived here for 25 years. I am passionate about Mexican food, particularly about tacos,
because the definition is so simple (a tortilla with anything inside) and yet the possibilities are endless and exciting.
There are so many varieties of tacos (grill, seafood, beef head, guisados, etc.) that people outside of Mexico don't know about,
and it is my mission to proudly show what they are and the best places to enjoy them. There's no better way to do this
than by foot in downtown Mexico City.

### What we'll do

We will meet in the Zócalo, Mexico City's main square, and from there we will walk to four everyday, no-nonsense restaurants
where the guests will be able to taste six or seven categories of tacos. I will explain what the Spanish names mean,
how they are prepared, what region in Mexico they come from. We will also try the drinks that usually complement them,
typical Mexican drinks but also soda and beer. Guests will have the chance to rest from the walk, and between spots
I will choose the best path to do some sightseeing, places not on your must-do list.

### What I'll provide

#### Lunch

All kinds of tacos!

#### Beer, Soft drinks, Water and Other

Traditional Mexican drinks like horchata, jamaica, etc. but also soft drinks and Mexican beer

#### Train

Subway ride back to Zócalo

### Where we'll be

We meet in the Zócalo and then walk to these four places, although not necessarily in that order:

- Basket tacos restaurant
- Taquería Los Cocuyos
- Taquería Tlaquepaque
- Beef head tacos street stand

The places we visit between spots will change depending on factors like weather and the interests of the guests, but will include:

- churches
- fly markets
- traditional markets (tianguis)
- govt buildings
- museums (outside)

### Notes

Although this is a walking tour we will do frequent stops and have food and drinks every now and then, so it will not be
physically challenging. However, wearing comfortable shoes is recommended.

### Group size

Up to 6 guests

### Who can come

Minimum age: 18
